# Webpack Starter
This is the start of an ongoing repository for working with Webpack. It starts with a simple web app with an html template and 2 JS files to get the hang of working with Webpack, webpack-dev-server and the html-webpack-plugin.

After going through some of the basics I added a branch to include a simple Vue.JS example as well.

Additional features are added onto the project and pushed as separate, labeled branches as time permits. Look at the branch listing in the Repository to identify which order features are added and what the last branch, which contains everything from all the previous branches, is.

There's nothing else in this branch, so go check out the various branches:

- 01_Simple_Template
- 02_Add CSS
- 03_Fix_FOUC
- 04_Add_SASS
- 05_Add_Vue

More to come???
